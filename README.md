## Introduction

More individuals, organizations and companies are starting to realize the potential of open source. An important question is obviously how projects can be funded to enable individuals to subsist and work on open source full time. This document aims to be an open guide to funding of open source projects.

## Crowdfunding

The concept has been around for a while and can at times be the spark that makes a project take off.

There are different models, the traditional crowdfunded project asks for funds given some budget and project proposition. If the project reach the donation goal you can receive extra benefits apart from the actual product.

Other models are more focused on the community, where members of the community pitch in a certain amount of money per time unit, e.g. once a month.
